## Run a node
1. Decide on a client by selecting a docker-compose file from the `compose-examples` directory.
2. Copy the `docker-compose.yaml` of your choice to the project's root directory (this directory).
3. Follow the guide included with the docker-compose (`README.md` of the selected docker-compose).

## FAQ
### My `docker-compose` command doesn't work (e. g. `ERROR: Version in "./docker-compose.yaml" is unsupported.`)
Most linux distributions (including Ubuntu) don't serve recent docker-compose versions in their package management. You can install a compatible version by following [official docker.io documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
